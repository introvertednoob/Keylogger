# remember to zlib.compress() your credentials!!!
# you can do this through the credential server creator (creds_creator.py), or you can do it manually.
# example: zlib.compress(b"key = 'api_key'\nusername = 'usr'\npassword = 'pwd'")
# NEVER HARDCODE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS INTO THE KEYLOGGER FILE ITSELF.
